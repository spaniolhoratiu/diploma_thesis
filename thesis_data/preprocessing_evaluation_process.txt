Idea: variables in terms of constellation nb. of points
Luminosity = LTY, if not specified, then it's 10

Preprocessing + test set:
0. andromeda - ok. reduced nb. of stars to 6
1. antilia - not sure where it is in Stellarium. preprocessing ok.
2. apus - ok. TDT=0.1 to recognize on 1.png
3. aquarius - ok. reduced nb. of stars to 15. need big PV to detect
4. aquila - ok. reduced nb. of stars to 8. TDT=0.1 to recognize on 1.png
5. ara - ok. TDT=0.02 to recognize on 1.png
6. aries - ok
7. auriga - ok. TDT=0.05 to recognize on 1.png
8. bootes - ok. AT=2 TDT=0.1 PV=10 to recognize on 1.png
9. caelum - ok. TDT=0.01, AT=3, PV=5 to recognize on 1.png
10. camelopardis - ok w/ reduced 1 star. TDT=0.05, AT=2, PV=10, LTY=7
11. cancer - ok
12. canes venatici - cannot be done. only 2 stars in constellation
13. canis major - ok. TDT=0.1, AT=2, PV=5
14. canis minor - cannot be done. cannot differentiate the 3 stars
15. capricornus - ok. TDT=0.05, AT=2, PV=5
16. carina - ok. reduced nb of stars by ~5 because of Stellarium. TDT=0.05, AT=2, PV=5
17. cassiopeia - ok. TDT=0.02, AT=2, PV=5
18. centaurus - ok. reduced nb of stars by 4 for better performance & detection. TDT=0.01, AT=3, PV=5
19. 
47. lepus - ok
